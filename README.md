## Static Site Generation

This project uses a custom static site generation (SSG) pipeline to create HTML files for each route, which greatly improves SEO. Here's how it works:

1. **Build process**: The `npm run build:static` command:
   - Compiles the React app with TypeScript (`tsc && vite build`)
   - Runs the prerender script (`node scripts/prerender.js`)

2. **Prerender script**: The prerender script:
   - Creates HTML files for each route defined in the routes array
   - Injects route-specific metadata (title, description, canonical URL, etc.)
   - Updates Open Graph and Twitter card data for social sharing

3. **Deploy-ready**: The generated static site is ready to deploy to any static hosting service.

## Deployment

The site can be deployed to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

```bash
# Preview production build
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```

### Netlify Deployment

This project includes a `netlify.toml` configuration file for easy deployment to Netlify. It handles:

- Build command and publish directory configuration
- SPA redirects for client-side routing
- Cache control for static assets
- Security headers for better protection

To deploy to Netlify:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically detect the configuration and deploy your site
