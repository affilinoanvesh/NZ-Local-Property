        question: "How often should I have my roof cleaned?",
        answer: "We recommend roof cleaning every 2-3 years for most Auckland properties. However, homes in areas with overhanging trees or high moisture may require more frequent cleaning. Regular cleaning prevents moss and lichen buildup that can damage roofing materials and cause leaks."
      },
      {
        question: "Are your water blasting techniques safe for all surfaces?",
        answer: "We adjust our water blasting pressure and techniques based on the specific surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces like some claddings or older brickwork, we use soft wash techniques with appropriate cleaning agents rather than high pressure that could cause damage."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide regular maintenance packages for outdoor areas?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer customized maintenance plans that can include seasonal cleaning, inspections, and preventative treatments. These plans can be tailored to your property's specific needs and budget, with options for quarterly, bi-annual, or annual services."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you fix leaking or damaged gutters as part of outdoor maintenance?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Gutter repair and maintenance is a key part of our outdoor maintenance services. We can repair leaking joints, replace damaged sections, adjust slopes for proper drainage, and ensure downpipes are functioning correctly."
